## To run this app locally do the following:

#### Run "git clone https://github.com/lewisjackson398/twitter-clone.git" in terminal.

#### Run "npm install"

#### Change the all links from  "http://ec2-3-9-189-76.eu-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:" to "http://localhost:" so it runs locally on your machine and not my aws instance

#### Create your own mongo db collection and change the MONGOD_URI in the app to match your connection string.

#### Update the jwt token password to whatever you like.

#### Run "npm run dev" to run the server and client side simultaneously, then try sign up and it should let you sign in if everything worked correctly.
